I am not, in any way, connected with the Hyperledger Iroha (or any Hyperledger project).  I am doing a self-study on blockchains.  This git is nothing more than a personal space for my experimentaions.

Hyperledger and Iroha are both owned by the Linux Foundation Project.  Their official website is:  https://www.hyperledger.org/
